	### general approach
.question
	:maruku
		The City of Portland has often been named the best bicycling city in the country. At the same time, car vehicle miles traveled are increasing while traffic congestion grows. Why do you think more Portlanders don’t walk, bicycle, or take transit for transportation, and what will you do to help Portland (especially your legislative district) become an even better city to bike in, as well as a great city to walk and take transit?
.answer
	:maruku
		Many people, in my opinion, are in a hurry to get from home to work and back. They do not consider the benefit of walking, taking public transit or biking. In addition, there is, in my opinion a stigma with public transit which is “you are either a Conservation Nut or Poor person and don’t have a car so you walk or ride the bus. **\[sic\]** In some cases this is true but, there are many who are Public Transit, Bike aware and do take these forms of transportation on a daily basis. I would lead by example in my campaign for the 36th House Seat. I am a biker and have a Cannondale R600 (Wife has a Giant and a Biancci) and am planning on “Biking my County” as part of my campaign and would love for your group to join us as a message that we are pro-bike.

%h3 choices and public perception
.question
	:maruku
		Critics of bicycle, pedestrian, and transit projects often contend cyclists, pedestrians, and transit users don’t pay their fair share in road taxes and other user fees. How would you make the case for allocating funds for bicycle, pedestrian, and transit projects?
.answer
	:maruku
		A great way of doing is to write a bill that requires any road construction to finish by the repainting of a bike late **\[sic\]** with symbols/pictures, sidewalks and bus stops. This would add little to the project and would get easy public backing. Again, I would lead by example and make sure I am at some of the repainting/restriping so the public would be able to see a legislator who cares.
		

%h3 state funding for active transportation
.question
	:maruku
		HB 1700 from 1971 ([ORS 366.514](http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/366.514)) requires the state set aside at least 1% of the highway fund to build bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Meanwhile, one-quarter of Oregonians (roughly a million people) are too poor, young, old or infirm to drive. Do you feel that the 1% is an adequate allotment to fulfill the safety and transportation needs of the ever-increasing bicycling and pedestrian community? If not, what would you do to change it?
.answer
	:maruku
		First I would look at the 1971 vs 2012 dollars and seek to enter a bill to raise the percentage be a reasonable amount here one that coincides with current needs and current dollars **\[sic\]**. I am very cognizant of the fact we are in a recession and monies for these projects are very limited. One straight forward way to improve these monies is by the recalculating of the 1% to 2012 dollars or at least close to that number.

%h3 traffic safety
.question
	:maruku
		Traffic-related crashes are the top cause of death and injury for Oregonians aged 1 to 34. Pedestrian injuries and deaths are a serious problem in Oregon, with one serious injury a day and one death a week, encompassing 14% of traffic deaths in Oregon and 30% of deaths in Portland. Not surprisingly, most walkers and cyclists are injured or killed on busy streets. How will you improve traffic safety for walkers and bicyclists, especially for youth?
.answer
	:maruku
		As a person that walks around Multnomah County on a regular bases and one that drives this area the serious problem that I have noticed is that MANY pedestrians, bikers, hikers etc are wearing clothes that cannot be seen especially at night **\[sic\]**. I propose a SEE MULTNOMAH COUNTY initiative that offers a visibility belt that can be seen especially in dark or low light areas around Multnomah County. In addition, I feel there should be some penalties for those that are involved in an accident and who are wearing black or cloths that blend into the background are a public danger and we should make sure that they are seen **\[sic\]**!

%h3 sensible traffic laws
.question
	:maruku
		For over 30 years, Idaho has had a law allowing cyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs, and come to a rolling stop instead of a complete stop (out of understanding of the laws of physics and the excessive use of stop signs on neighborhood streets). Over those last 30 years, Idaho police departments have seen no increase in safety problems, and have provided testimony in favor of the law. The Oregon legislature has considered passing a similar law in Oregon, but has failed to. What are your views on such a proposal?
.answer
	:maruku
		This question, in my opinion, goes hand in hand with the above question. These “rolling stops” are not the issue the BEING SEEN is the issue. Whether or not we pass these types of laws are important if the biker etc can be seen **\[sic\]**. The problem I see here is that “bikers” must obey the rules of the road as do drivers in cars etc. If a driver of a car can be cited I feel that bikers must obey the same rules as auto drivers.

%h3 CRC highway mega-project
.question
	:maruku
		There has been a lot of pressure to build the most expensive public works project in the region’s history, the five-mile long highway project known as the Columbia River Crossing. Despite being a multi-billion dollar project, bicycle and pedestrian facilities involved are substandard, including an under-highway mile-long path, a five-block corkscrew detour into Vancouver, and a mostly minimum-width-allowed 16-foot path width, all for a facility designed to serve the next 100 years. The project is diverting billions of dollars from other regional priorities to build an expansion that won’t solve congestion. What are your views on the mega-project and what would you do about its funding as a legislator?
.answer
	:maruku
		Very simple and short answer: “This project MUST be defunded and a Forensic-accountant needs to be employed to investigate this project”. (You may quote me on this one).

%h3 cleaner transportation, better choices through land use
.question
	:maruku
		Smart land use planning has a huge effect on how many people use transportation choices. In 2010, legislators passed Senate Bill 1059, which requires Metro to make its land use planning decisions lead to specific reductions in global warming pollution. It also requires Eugene-Springfield to plan on how it would accomplish such reductions. Would you support an effort to provide $300,000 for a grant to do scenario planning for one of Oregon’s other four Metro areas, which would be designed as a competitive pilot effort to model how Salem/Keizer, Corvallis, the Rogue Valley, or Bend could reduce their transportation pollution? If so, how would you go about finding that funding?
.answer
	:maruku
		Under Oregon’s current cash crisis, I would have to say NO. But, in the future, when our economy is on a better footing of course and this grant makes sense. Fiscal responsibility is a cornerstone of my campaign.

%h3 transit funding
.question
	:maruku
		Transit systems throughout the state continue to struggle to make ends meet, especially in their quest for operating funds. In response, often service is cut while fares are increased. While the payroll tax cap was increased in 2009, it only increased for some cities. If you think public transit funding is inadequate, what sources of funds would you work increase or create as a legislator?
.answer
	:maruku
		I would be against any type of tax increase for Transit Funding as this creates undue hardships for those that would use the system. Possible funding ideas are to make better allocations of our resources. Bidding for contracts need more oversight and my scrutiny. I would start here whereby freeing up already allocated funds **\[sic\]**.

%h3 transportation equity
.question
	:maruku
		Recent census data show nearly 10,000 people of color, mostly African Americans, have moved from Portland’s city core to the city’s eastern edges over the past ten years. East Portland has much sparser sidewalks and bikeways, grocery stores and parks, and less access to transit. How would you ensure these increasingly diverse and historically under-invested neighborhoods are revitalized for their current residents? How would you improve transportation choices for low income communities and communities of color?
.answer
	:maruku
		As a walker in this District I am fully aware of the problem we have with lack of sidewalks, bike lanes and unpaved streets. As a legislator I will work to rectify this problem to help make our walkers and bikes safe. The areas of color will factor in as there are problems with their neighborhoods too.

%h3 personal example and understanding
.question
	:maruku
		How do you currently travel around town, and how do you commute to work?
.answer
	:maruku
		I walk, and ride the bus. As we have one car (got rid of the second one) we ride share, and I personally carpool to work daily!

%h3 past accomplishments
.question
	:maruku
		Do you have any specific accomplishments in improving the quality of life for bicycle, pedestrian and transit users in Oregon or other places?
.answer
	:maruku
		Successfully completed the WINDMILL Century, am working on the Cookie Monster Metric Century. Was an avid participant in the American Lung Association bike trip on the central coast of California for over five years.
