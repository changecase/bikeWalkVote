  ### Who We Are
    
  Bike Walk Vote works to elect candidates who best support Oregon's bicyclists, pedestrians, and transit riders. We also work on ballot measures.

  Formed in 2004, we have worked in elections in 2004, 2006, and 2008. Our endorsed candidates and measures won 15 of 19 elections.

  After a hiatus in 2010, we have relaunched Bike Walk Vote. Our first action was endorsing Alissa Keny-Guyer for appointment to the Oregon legislature, an appointment she won. We are now ramping up for a busy 2012 election year.
  
  ### Our Unique Value

  As a political action committee, Bike Walk Vote goes where most non-profits cannot - directly into candidate elections. We endorse candidates and work to elect our strongest allies. While advocacy, organizing, education and lobbying are all valuable activities, the most influential action is electing the right people in the first place.

%h3 The People
%p Bike Walk Vote is run by an eight person volunteer steering committee who represent a cross-section of skills and interests in the biking, walking, and transit community.

  ### The Questionnaire
  
  We continually work to have our questionnaires inform candidates about the most current issues in the bike, walk, and transit communities. Each race may have a different questionnaire, which helps inform our endorsement decisions. We also sometimes supplement written questionnaires with in-person interviews.

  Curious what issues we're asking about? We had [these Mayoral race questions](/questions.pdf "questions for the next Mayor \(PDF\)") on display at the 2011 Launch Party.

  Interestested in the candidates' answers to the questionnaire? We are posting their answers on our [responses](/responses.html "the candidates' responses to the bike walk vote questionnaire") page.
