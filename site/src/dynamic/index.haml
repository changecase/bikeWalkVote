:markdown
  **Portland** February 17, 2012.

  Bike Walk Vote, the political arm of Portland’s biking, walking, and transit community has decided to endorse [Jefferson Smith for Mayor](http://www.jeffersonsmith.com/ "Jefferson Smith for Mayor"). Jefferson Smith sets himself apart from the other candidates with his compelling _commitment to promoting equitable transportation_ investments in underserved Portland communities, and his unequivocal cost-conscious critique of the proposed _Columbia River Crossing_ supports the smartest path for saving the most taxpayer dollars while moving people and freight.
