/%h2 Bike Walk Vote Endorses Jefferson Smith for Mayor

/:markdown
/  **Portland** February 17, 2012.

/  Bike Walk Vote, the political arm of Portland’s biking, walking, and transit community has decided to endorse [Jefferson Smith for Mayor](http://www.jeffersonsmith.com/ "Jefferson Smith for Mayor"). Jefferson Smith sets himself apart from the other candidates with his compelling _commitment to promoting equitable transportation_ investments in underserved Portland communities, and his unequivocal cost-conscious critique of the proposed _Columbia River Crossing_ supports the smartest path for saving the most taxpayer dollars while moving people and freight.

/%h3 what they said
/%p We didn’t make this decision lightly, but had a written questionnaire, an in-person interview, a shared bike commute, and a public forum with each of the candidates. We also reviewed what they’ve been saying for the past six months to other people.

%h2 We Did It!

:markdown

  Thanks to the support of people like you, Bike Walk Vote PAC had our most
  successful election night in our brief history.

  We made nine endorsements this primary season. Seven of those candidates won their races, and
  the other two made it to November runoff elections. We went undefeated!


%h2 our victories

%ul.people
  %li
    %h3 Jeff Reardon
    %p Electing Jeff Reardon as the Democratic nominee in House District 48. Reardon took out a ten-year incumbent, the vehemently pro-CRC Mike Schaufler. It was the first time in nearly 20 years that a Democratic incumbent has been taken out in the primary.
  %li
    %h3 Bob Stacey
    %p Electing Bob Stacey to the Metro Council. Stacey is a lifelong advocate for livable communities and transportation choices, and an eloquent opponent of the CRC highway mega-project.
  %li
    %h3 Sam Chase
    %p Electing Sam Chase to the Metro Council. Affordability advocate Chase got over 58% of the vote in a five-person race, avoiding a November runoff.
  %li
    %h3 Dick Schouten
    %p Re-electing Commissioner Dick Schouten in Washington County. Schouten, the leading voice for transportation choices in Oregon’s second-most populous county, beat back a well-funded opponent to earn re-election.
  


%h2 runoff
    
%p The runoff results are no less impressive.

      ### [Jefferson Smith](/questionnaires/smith.pdf "Jefferson Smith's responces to the bike walk vote questionnaire")

      We helped Jefferson Smith overcome low starting poll numbers and being significantly outspent to make it to the November runoff. Jefferson used anti-CRC messaging in television ads to demonstrate his leadership and shared priorities with Portlanders.
  %li
    %h3 Mary Nolan
    %p We worked with Mary Nolan to go from being a virtual unknown to fight the incumbent City Councilor to a dead heat. This is the first time in 26 years a sitting Portland Councilor has been taken to a runoff.

%p We have a good chance to win these races in November if we continue to devote significant time, money, and energy to the campaigns.

%p Thank you for helping making this happen. We couldn’t have done it without you.
