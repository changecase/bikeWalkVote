  ## Bike Walk Vote Endorses Jefferson Smith for Mayor
  
  **Portland** February 17, 2012.

  Bike Walk Vote, the political arm of Portland’s biking, walking, and transit community has decided to endorse [Jefferson Smith for Mayor](http://www.jeffersonsmith.com/ "Jefferson Smith for Mayor"). Jefferson Smith sets himself apart from the other candidates with his compelling _commitment to promoting equitable transportation_ investments in underserved Portland communities, and his unequivocal cost-conscious critique of the proposed _Columbia River Crossing_ supports the smartest path for saving the most taxpayer dollars while moving people and freight.

  Bike Walk Vote focused on the three most viable mayoral candidates: Smith, Hales and Brady, and all three of them enthusiastically sought our endorsement. Our endorsement was based on comparing the candidates’ questionnaire responses, in-person interviews, their performance in the February 6th [transportation debate](http://psuvanguard.com/news/psu%E2%80%99s-lincoln-hall-battleground-mayoral-debate/ "PSU's Vangaurd on the Local Motion mayoral candidate forum") at Portland State University, as well as our rolling interview, where Bike Walk Vote rode along with each candidate on a commute from their home to their campaign office, reflecting on how we can all best share the roads together. The decision to endorse Smith was reached by the consensus of the Bike Walk Vote Steering Committee.
  
  > “We encourage Portlanders who care about biking, walking, and transit to support Jefferson Smith, who brings _strong leadership_ and a commitment to a city that works for everyone,” said [Peter Welte](/about.html#peter-welte "about Peter"), Co-Chair of Bike Walk Vote.
  > 
  > “Jefferson Smith has demonstrated a strong commitment to creating _safe and convenient options_ for walking, biking, and taking transit for all Portlanders.  His focus on _transportation funding equity_ for historically underserved neighborhoods reflects a vision of Portland that we all share,” said [Heidi Guenin](/about.html#heidi-guenin "about Heidi"), Policy Co-Chair of Bike Walk Vote.
  > 
  > “Jefferson Smith brings the most common sense approach to the _Columbia River Crossing highway mega-project_, to help us focus our scarce transportation funding on the investments that Portlanders will get the most benefit from,” added [Evan Manvel](/about.html#evan-manvel "about Evan"), Co-Chair of Bike Walk Vote.
  > 
  > “Jefferson Smith has the _vision and leadership_ that will help us get to the future where all Portlanders can safely and comfortably walk, bike and use transit to get where they need to go.” [Kathryn Doherty-Chapman](/about.html#kathryn-dohertychapman "about Kathryn"), Secretary of Bike Walk Vote said.
  
  Bike Walk Vote’s special acknowledgement goes to [Charlie Hales](/responces/mayor/charlie-hales.html "Charlie Hales' responce to the Bike Walk Vote questionaire"), who made a commendably strong impression. Hales distinguished himself over Brady and compelled our most thoughtful consideration in comparison to Smith. His vision for a multi-modal city and his talent for promoting collaboration between agencies have literally helped build the Portland we call home. We are thankful to Charlie for his work.
  
  Brady’s personally positive outlook on walking and cycling were overshadowed by her reluctance to increase local investments in active transportation, putting her at odds with Portland’s vision for a healthy, sustainable city.
  
  Bike Walk Vote will actively support Jefferson Smith’s campaign to be Portland’s next mayor and will mobilize the transportation community’s engagement in this election.
