      ### [Election Night a Big One for Bike Walk Vote PAC](http://bikeportland.org/2012/05/17/election-night-a-big-one-for-bike-walk-vote-pac-71827 "election night coverage from bikeportland.org")

      Our 2012 election season has been super successful. Jonathan Maus of [BikePortland](http://www.bikeportland.org "BikePortland: news, blog, bikes") covered the extent of our success.

      > With the votes counted from the May 15th primary, candidates supported by Bike Walk Vote did extremely well. In fact, five of the seven candidates they endorsed won outright and the remaining two — [Jefferson Smith](/responses/mayor/jefferson-smith.html "Jefferson Smith's responses to the questionaire") for mayor and [Mary Nolan](/responses/portland-city-council-position-1/mary-nolan.html "Mary Nolon's responses to the questionaire") for City Council — finished very close seconds and will sail into runoffs in November.
