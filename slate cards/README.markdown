# Attribution

Photos here need correct attribution. For each CC photo, we need to include the photographer's name (or nom de plume) as well as a link to their online profile.

Take a look at the meta info to learn name & url info.

Final slate card designs should credit the photographers. If we have a way to let them know we're using their image, we should do that too.
